                    This site shows information about all of the air quality monitoring stations in Maryland. It also provides a map that details the
                    PM-2.5 monitoring stations, their current readings, and guesses about the air quality based on those readings.
                </p>

                    CO is carbon monoxide, a toxic gas that is more dense than air. It is reponsible for most fatal air poisonings in many countries.
                    It can cause dizzyness, seizure, and even death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SO2 is sulfur dioxide, a toxic gas that comes from volcanic activity and fossil fuel use. It can cause lung disease and death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NO2 is nitrogen dioxide. It is a gas that can cause inflammation, create ozone, and worsen asthma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OZ is ozone. It is a gas that can damage lungs and the nervous system and especally affects kids, teens, people 65+ people who spend
                    time outdoors, and people who already have lung diseases.
